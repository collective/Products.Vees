Introduction
============

Vee replaces the normal, linear science report and puts it into a visual map.
This map is organized around a graphic of a Vee.  This Vee map makes sense to 
our brains about the way knowledge is created and becomes a tool which actually
makes it easy for students to take charge of their own experiments/inquiry. 
Say good bye to 'cook-book' labs.
